# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is a tool/software that allows you to document with your code files with ease on your local machine. Github is a cloud based program that connects git users on the internet.  

  Researched answer: Git is a software that allows users to maintain, document and track their source codes. Github is a git hosting service that connects git users via the internet and allows users to manage their git repositories online.  



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: True or false operators will return a Boolean value.

  Researched answer: There are a multitude of Comparison operators that will return of a Boolean value.
  == , === , != , !== <=, >= ,< , >
  I would love to expand more if you're needing further explanation on each of the comparison values previously mentioned.
  <!-- (Not sure if this what is you're wanting but I imagine myself responding that way in a interview)   -->

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is the 'gps' location of a string or an array. A value is a particular outcome for a code.

  Researched answer: Values come in all of primitive data types. They are characters (numbers, strings, booleans, etc) assigned in which JavaScript logically knows how to interact with. Index is action determining specific placement of a particular data type i.e String & Arrays.   



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: An iteration is an action that runs code repeatedly until a condition is met.

  Researched answer: An iteration is the process of running code over and over again until conditions are met. It is the process in which a segment of code is executed. Loops are an example of an iteration.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair program often consist of a 'driver' someone who has 'hands on the keyboard' and a 'navigator' someone who is directing the flow of code and looking out for typos and errors.  

  Researched answer: Pair programming is team based approach to coding. It often involves a 'driver' who is writing the code and a 'navigator/observer' who is actively reviewing each line of code in real time. Roles are often reverse when a set criteria is met or by a time method.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Takes on an additional function or returns another function output.

2. Jest: QA for your code. Grammarly for code.

3. Objects: Takes in key:value in pairs. A more refined way of indexing an Array.

4. Method: When a function belongs to another function. Function-ception.

5. Classes: Modified functions that contain data and behavior. Reusable and can store all data types.
